The Rust decision making process is oriented around teams. For important decisions, we strive to achieve consensus, meaning that everyone agrees that the idea is acceptable. A consensus-oriented structure is good for ensuring that designs meet everyone’s needs. However, for consensus to work well, it’s really important that everyone on the team has the skills to work well together; otherwise it can easily descend into discord, hurt feelings, and logjam. **The principles are an attempt to define what skills people need to succeed as a member of the Rust community.** This is about more than Rust team membership: to varying degrees, these skills apply to people who comment on RFCs, who do one-off contributions to the compiler, or who help new users on our various forums.
