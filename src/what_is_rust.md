## What is Rust?

* A language **empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software**.
* An **open-source community** focused on creating, designing, and maintaining that language and its ecosystem.

## What are the Rustacean Principles?

The **Rustacean principles** are a set of principles which guide us in building Rust. They begin with a description of [how Rust empowers its users](./how_rust_empowers.md). This section describes the various goals that we shoot for when designing elements of Rust.

Rust is developed and maintained by the members of its [various teams](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance). The next section of this site, [How to Rustacean](./how_to_rustacean.md), is a guide for the ways that members of those teams are expected to act. You can think of it like a companion to the [Code of Conduct][CoC]: whereas the [CoC] describes the bare minimum expected of any Rust participant, the [How to Rustacean] section describes what is means to excel.

Finally, the [case studies](./case_studies.md) section applies both the previous sections to various examples from Rust's history, and shows how the principles can help guide us.
