# Rustacean Principles

## What is Rust?

* A language **empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software**.
* An **open-source community** focused on creating, designing, and maintaining that language and its ecosystem.

## What are the Rustacean Principles?

The **Rustacean principles** are a set of principles which guide us in building Rust. They begin with a description of [how Rust empowers its users](./how_rust_empowers.md). This section describes the various goals that we shoot for when designing elements of Rust.

Rust is developed and maintained by the members of its [various teams](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance). The next section of this site, [How to Rustacean](./how_to_rustacean.md), is a guide for the ways that members of those teams are expected to act. You can think of it like a companion to the [Code of Conduct][CoC]: whereas the [CoC] describes the bare minimum expected of any Rust participant, the [How to Rustacean] section describes what is means to excel.

Finally, the [case studies](./case_studies.md) section applies both the previous sections to various examples from Rust's history, and shows how the principles can help guide us.

## Why develop these principles?

The goal of these principles is to help us to be more precise as we go about our work in the Rust org. The [How Rust ought to feel](./how_rust_feels.md) section enumerates the kinds of considerations we should consider, and can help us to think more carefully about designs. For example, when we are considering a change, we can talk about whether it works against "it compiles it works" in favor of "empowering", and look for previous case studies that made similar tradeoffs.

The [How to Rustacean](./how_to_rustacean.md) is similar. We've often had a hard time elaborating on the kinds of behaviors that we are looking for when we select Rust team members. This makes it hard for people to know what they ought to do, but it also makes it very hard for us to communicate where improvement is needed.

## Is this "official"?

No -- right now, this is a work-in-progress being developed by nikomatsakis in collaboration with lots of people within the Rust community. When it takes settled shape, it may indeed move to the Rust org as something more official.
