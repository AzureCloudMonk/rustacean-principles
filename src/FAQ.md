## Who developed these principles? Are they "official"?

No -- right now, this is a work-in-progress being developed by nikomatsakis in collaboration with lots of people within the Rust community. When it takes settled shape, it may indeed move to the Rust org as something more official.

## Why develop these principles?

The goal of these principles is to help us to be more precise as we go about our work in the Rust org. The [Rust empowers by being...](./how_rust_empowers.md) section is primarily intended to help guide discussions about the effects of features on our users. The [How to Rustacean](./how_to_rustacean.md) section is meant to help us in describing the kinds of behaviors that we are looking for when we select Rust team members. This makes it hard for people to know what they ought to do, but it also makes it very hard for us to communicate where improvement is needed.
