# How Rust ought to feel

This section identifies the way that Rust ought to feel, when everything is going right. These are the goals by which we evaluate new features.

## [⚙️ Reliable](./how_rust_feels/reliable.md): "if it compiles, it works"

> One of the great things about Rust is the feeling of "it if compiles, it works". This is what allows you to do a giant refactoring and find that the code runs on the first try. It is what lets you deploy code that uses parallelism or other fancy features without exhausting fuzz testing and worry about every possible corner case.

## [🐎 Performant](./how_rust_feels/performant.md): "idiomatic code runs efficiently"

> In Rust, the fastest code is often the most high-level: convenient features like closures, iterators, or async-await map down to code that is at once efficient and which uses minimal memory.

## [💪🏽 Empowering](./how_rust_feels/empowering.md): "just a few lines of code can do a lot of work"

> Rust offers a wide selection of libraries and abstractions that can be quickly combined to create complex applications. 

## [💎 Polished](./how_rust_feels/polished.md): "Rust gets the big *and* the small things right"

> Rust is built with an attention to detail. Whether it's the error messages, the tooling, or the details of the type system or APIs, we try to anticipate and meet our users' needs, along with things they didn't know they wanted.

## [🤸 Versatile](./how_rust_feels/versatile.md): "whatever it is I want to do, I can use Rust to do it"

> Rust can be used to build everything from simple scripts to web servers to WebAssembly programs to kernel extensions and embedded systems. Rust gives you the ability to control low-level details and exposes the capabilities of the underlying system.
