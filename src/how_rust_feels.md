# How Rust ought to feel

This section identifies the way that Rust ought to feel, when everything is going right. These are the goals by which we evaluate new features.

## [⚙️ Reliable](./how_rust_feels/reliable.md): "if it compiles, it works"

> One of the great things about Rust is the feeling of "it if compiles, it works". This is what allows you to do a giant refactoring and find that the code runs on the first try. It is what lets you deploy code that uses parallelism or other fancy features without exhausting fuzz testing and worry about every possible corner case.

## [🐎 Performant](./how_rust_feels/performant.md): "idiomatic code runs efficiently"

> In Rust, the fastest code is often the most high-level: convenient features like closures, iterators, or async-await map down to code that is at once efficient and which uses minimal memory.

## [🧩 Productive](./how_rust_feels/productive.md): "just a few lines of code can do a lot of work"

> Rust and its ecosystem offer a wide array of powerful building blocks that can be combined and recombined. The result is that standing up quality code can be done in record time.

## [🔧 Transparent](./how_rust_feels/transparent.md): "able to predict low-level details and control them"

> The translation from Rust to underlying machine code is straightforward and predictable. If needed, you have options to control the low-level details of how your application works.

## [🥰 Supportive](./how_rust_feels/supportive.md): "build the system you want to build, whoever you are"

> We strive to make our tools polished and friendly, and we look for every opportunity to guide people towards success. Part of that is building a community that eagerly shares its knowledge in a welcoming and inclusive way.

## [🤸 Versatile](./how_rust_feels/versatile.md): "whatever it is I want to do, I can use Rust to do it"

> Rust scales well both up and down: it is well-suited to building everything from simple scripts to web servers to WebAssembly programs to kernel extensions and embedded systems. It is usable on both common and esoteric platforms.
