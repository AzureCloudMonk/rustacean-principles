# ðŸ¤¸ Versatile: "you can do anything with Rust"

> Rust scales well both up and down: it is well-suited to building everything from simple scripts to web servers to WebAssembly programs to kernel extensions and embedded systems. It is usable on both common and esoteric platforms.

## In tension with...

Feeling versatile can be in tension with feeling [supportive] and [productive].

## Mechanisms

What are some of the ways that we make Rust feel **versatile**?

We don't want Rust users to feel they have to "drop down" to C or some other language; they should be able to use unsafe Rust to get their job done. Features like "inline assembly" are following in this vein.

An example of this mechanism in action is `repr(C)`. Although our default struct layout is not defined ()
