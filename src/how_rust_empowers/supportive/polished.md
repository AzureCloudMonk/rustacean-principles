# Polished developer experience

> The details count.

Rust tools strive to provide a polished, smooth experience for our developers. One example is how the compiler offers quality error messages that attempt to not only indicate an error, but to teach the user how the language works, and offer helpful suggestions for how to fix their code. For tools like cargo, this manifests in careful CLI design that makes the "easy things easy" (but of course, for Rust to feel [versatile], we have to go beyond that).
