# Specify only what's necessary

Rust borrowed the idea of zero-cost abstractions from the C++ community. Bjarne Stroustroup defined zero-cost abstractions as, "What you don't use, you don't pay for. And further: What you do use, you couldn't hand code any better." We design our abstractions with these goals in mind as well.
